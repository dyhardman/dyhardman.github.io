  <h3>inDecision: An App for the Indecisive</h3>
  <p>
    This was my final project for one of my informatics courses (INFO 200: Intellectual Foundations of Informatics) at the University of Washington.  Our assignment was to create an app or website that is aimed at solving one of society's current problems.  My group and I decided to create an a mobile application that would be aimed at solving our generations most overlooked issues; indecisiveness.  This being a prototype and not an actual working app there are limitations, but it can give an idea of what the app may look and function like.  Indecision works by using artificial intelligence and machine learning to suggest options for the user in a variety of consumer categories including food, retail, and activities.  The app then forces the user to make a decision where the user can quickly and efficiently come to a final choice.

  <h3>RateMyPlate: An App for the Hungry College Student</h3>
  <p>
    This was my final project for one of my informatics courses (INFO 102: Gender and Informatics) at the University of Washington.  Shown above are a few of the screens for the app if it were to be develoed.  This will give you an idea of the aesthetic layout of the application and what some of its functionalities are.  Our assignment was to create an app or website that is aimed at solving a problem at the university level.  My group and I decided to create a mobile application aimed at making on-campus dining more accessible for all members of a college campus community.  The app works essentially like a more focused version of Yelp that allows user to find, and rate food options all across campus.  This eliminates the trouble of not knowing what locations are open on campus and what food there is.  This application is especially useful for first time college students who are still new to the campus, and also visitors who are passing through and wondering what kind of dining options are offered.
