      <h3 class = "videoTitle">Shuttle</h3>
      <p class = "videoDescription">
        This is a documentary I created as the result of a quarter long research project as part of my Intermediate Multimodal English course (ENGL 202) at the University of Washington.  My goal for this research project was to investigate the negative social implications surrounding less popular sports in the United States with a strong focus on Badminton.  This documentary consists of personal stories whilst playing the sport over the last couple years as well as interviews of close friends in my local UW Badminton community.

      <h3 class = "videoTitle">The Stranger</h3>
      <p class = "videoDescription">
        This is a quarter long short film I worked on with a team of filmmakers in the LUX Film Production Club at the University of Washington.  My role in this project was as the main video editor, where I was responsible for compiliing all the footage and turning it into the finished product in post-production.  My workflow consisted of working in Adobe Premiere for a majority of my time as well as referring to the shotlist and script.  Working on this project provided me with my first large project in video editing as well as working with others in my editing workflow.  I had to work closely with my Director and Director of Photography in order to acheive exactly what they envisioned on screen.

      <h3 class = "videoTitle">Life in a Minute or Two</h3>
      <p class = "videoDescription">
        This is a final project I created in my Cinema and Media Arts course (CMS 301).  My assignment was to portray "Life in a minute or two" by combining pre-existing video clips as well as my own footage to portray time in an interesting way.  Therefore I was responsible for both filming portions of the film and editing the whole film.  After completing this assignment I had to further analyze my own work in how it relates to the greater theme of time while also referring to other films that we analyzed in class.  Working through this project gave me more experience in creating with a thematic purpose, while also being able to critically analyze my own work from a technical perspective.

      <h3 class = "videoTitle">The Subject</h3>
      <p class = "videoDescription">
        This is a quarter long short film I worked on with a team of filmmakers in the LUX Film Production Club at the University of Washington.  My role in this project was as the 1st Assistant Director, meaning I was in charge of making sure that filming progressed efficiently, and on time.  I was also responsible for cueing the film crew for both video and sound while informing the editor of takes and scene numbers so that the editing process is smoother in post-production.  This was my first experience working with a group of filmmakers on a large project and it gave me insight on how to manage a group of people so that work can be completed efficiently while also accomplishing the vision of the Director.

      These "microfilms" are video projects that act as a fun filmmaking challenge.  Brainstorm, film, and edit a video in an hour or less.

      <h3 class = "videoTitle">A Hunger for Disappointment</h3>
      <p class = "videoDescription">
        This is a project I completed as a part of my Digital Media Arts class (ART 74) at San Jose State University.  This video takes some visual style cues from my own work in film making while also borrowing elements from comedic skits I have seen on the internet. It has the look of a typical skit/short film with sounds that are very contrasting in both calm and sad tones. The music drives the emotion of this video as it helps the audience empathize with the character. It is intended to be viewed from a somewhat comedic perspective as this is partly a fun way to mimic other comedic skits online. The audience should experience it as such, in an informal setting where they are free to laugh without judgement.

        One of the Microfilms I created while I was a part of the LUX Film Production Club at the University of Washington.  Our required prop for this challenge was a rubber duck which inspired my team and I to create a horror film.  In this project I was responsible for filming and editing.

      <p class = "videoDescription">
        One of the Microfilms I created while I was a part of the LUX Film Production Club at the University of Washington.  For this film, my team and I had a required line we had to use, "raw cookie dough can give you salmonella."  Due to the truth of this statement we decided to make this film about fake news and information.  With that information in mind there was no better way to accomplish this than to make the film a satire of our favorite president Donald Trump.

        The first Microfilm I created while I was a part of the LUX Film Production Club at the University of Washington.  Our required prop was a kazoo which was the central focus of our film.  As a team we decided to make the kazoo the star of a horror film.  I was responsible for filming and editing.
